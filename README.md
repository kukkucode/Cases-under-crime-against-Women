# Cases-under-crime-against-Women
In this project we are going to perform Exploratory Data Analysis on crimes against Women in India. The actual number of crimes which are taking place are much higher than the one being registered. Keeping in mind that our report can only focus on the crime which are being registered to the authority. Now the another problem is that, that all the cases which are being registered are not handled properly by the assigned authorities. In some cases investigation are not done properly, some cases are just delayed by the higher authority, some are just being withdrawn due to some external or internal pressure and there are many more. We will be covering the quantitative analysis of these types of cases in our report.
